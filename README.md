pushover.sh
===========

Shell-script wrapper around curl for sending messages through PushOver

Usage
=====

    pushover.sh [-t <title>] [-d <device>] [-p <priority>] [-s <sound>] <message>

Before you can actually use this script, you must create `${HOME}/.config/pushover.conf` with the following contents:

    TOKEN="your application's token here"
    USER="your user key here"


Shell compatibility
===================

A word of warning: I use bash (as in real bash, not dash) on all of my machines and I have a tendency to forget what syntax is cross-shell compatible. If things behave very strangely for you, this is very likely the first thing you should check. Better yet, if you know a better way a particular line could be implemented, don't hesitate to submit a patch. I would really like for this script to someday work on bash, dash and sh equally. :-)
